Salamander locomotion is to a large extent controlled by central pattern generators:

* there is only minimal modulation from descending signals 
* two drive signals, one for each side of the spinal cord -- these modulate speed, heading, and type of gait

# ROS Core Ideas

ROS is used in many universities and companies as a standard for robot programming.

* Peer to peer System -- ROS is a middleware: Individual programs communicate using a given API (ROS messages, services, etc.).
* Distributed: Programs can run on multiple computers and communicate.
* Multi-lingual: ROS modules can be written in many common languages (C++, Python, MATLAB, Java, etc.).
* Light-weight communication: Stand-alone libraries are wrapped around with a thin ROS layer.
* Free and open-source: Most ROS software is open-source and free to use.

# Summary: Passive Walker

They realize a configuration that ingeniously couples two physical oscillations to realize walking almost for free.

:::incremental

* a lateral oscillation lifts the left and the right leg in alternation from the ground 
* superimposed is the natural swing movement of a leg that behaves like a pendulum. This moves the free leg forward while the body "topples" a bit forward around the supported leg. 
* a proper coupling of both motions can produce an automatic and self-stabilizing gait along an inclined plane 
* human walking seems to be constructed around such a mechanism: instead of computing everything from scratch, a natural motion is only modulated and reshaped, saving both energy and computation.

# Passive Walker -- Exploiting the Body Structure

![](../data/02/PassiveWalker_World_Record.mp4){height=600px data-autoplay=true controls=1 start=1}

# Embodiment

The clear cut between "computation in the brain" and "sensing/acting in the body" is only a first-order approximation: 

:::incremental

* since the sensors and actuators determine what can be measured and how things can be done, the body cannot be avoided to be part of the "representation" on which the computations in the (robot) brain have to be based. 
* different body designs can change the computational difficulty of the same task from "easy" to "almost impossible" 
* clever architectures exploit this fact (as probably did evolution) and include the body to let its physics carry out some of the computations "for free", leaving a more doable task for the brain.
