# Co-evolution of Internal Representation {.columns}

*“When we examine very simple level intelligence we find that explicit representations and models of the world simply get in the way. It turns out to be better to use the world as its own model.”* \

(Brooks, 1991: Intelligence without Representation)

*“Representation-making might be a crucial bootstrapping device for higher mental function. At some point external representation-making becomes internalised to form the basis of thinking, in the sense of inner dialogs or mental imaging. So internal representations do not come before external representations but follow or co-evolve with them.”* \

# Inverse Model {.columns}

## {.right}

Aimed reaching movements.

Function: Transforms target points in space into joint values (trajectories)

\

*Inverse (dynamics) models form a special class of controller. They infer the action that takes the animal from the current state to a future outcome state. If this future outcome state is the ``goal'' of the animal, the inverse model generates the action that aims to achieve it.*

## {.right}

Required for fast movements.

Function: Predicts outcome of motor command (uses Efference copy) \

*Forward (dynamics) models predict the future state of the animal's body and the environment given the current state and an action, either real or imagined. Internal forward models are used to predict the future consequences of actions. Comparing these predictions with sensory inputs enables filtering-based estimation of body and environment state.*

# Sensor Fusion

Sensor Fusion Model: Integrate different modalities \
 => compensate for errors

In Animals many sensory/ proprioceptive information.

* Inverse Model: Transform target points in space into joint trajectories
* Forward Model: Anticipate sensory feedback (using efference copies)
* Sensor fusion: Exploit redundant sensor information to cancel out noise

# Body Models in Biology

*“The most important part of the world, […] is the own body. This leads to the speculation that a basis of such a world model might be formed by a model of the own body.”* [@cruse_feeling_1999] 

\

## Body Schema {.definition .fragment}

*“The body schema is the long-term representation between the spatial relations among body parts and the knowledge about the actions that they can and cannot perform.”* [@acost05body]

:::col60

* Cerebellum: *a function is system identiﬁcation: to build internal models that predict sensory outcome of motor commands*
* Parietal Cortex: *state estimation: integrate the predicted proprioceptive and visual outcomes with sensory feedback to form a belief about how the commands affected the states*
* basal ganglia: *learning costs and rewards associated with sensory state*
* primary and the premotor cortices: *transforming beliefs about proprioceptive and visual states, respectively, into motor commands.*
