# Manipulator arms versus mobile robots

*  Both are concerned with forward and inverse (backward) kinematics
* However, for mobile robots, encoder values don‘t map to unique robot poses
* And mobile robots can move unbound with respect to their environment
* There is no direct (=instantaneous) way to measure the robot’s position (end-effector)
* Robot positions must be integrated over time and depend on the path taken  This leads to inaccuracies of the position (motion) estimate
* Understanding mobile robot motion starts with understanding wheel constraints placed on
